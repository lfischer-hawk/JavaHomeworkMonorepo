## Module 4: Exercise 4.4
(Geometry: Area of a hexagon) The area of a hexagon can be computed using the following formula (s is the length of a side): [...]

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the side of a hexagon and displays its area. 

# Purpose of Technical Implementation
Calculate the area of a hexagon using mathematical constants and functions.

# Psuedocode
```input = input("Side length")
area = (6 * (input^2)) / (4 * tan(pi/6))
print(area)
```
